# Exercise 2.4 - Wrap it all up

It happens that the job of a CISO and her team is difficult even if they have in place all necessary tools, because the tools don’t integrate with each other. When there is a security breach, an analyst has to perform a triage, chasing all relevant piece of information across the entire infrastructure, taking days to understand what’s going on and ultimately perform any sort of remediation.

Ansible Security Automation is a Red Hat initiative to facilitate the integration of a wide range of security solutions through a common and open automation language: Ansible. Ansible Security Automation is designed to help security analysts investigate and remediate security incidents faster.

This is how ansible security automation can integrate three different security products, an enterprise firewall, an IDS, and a SIEM, to help security analysts and operators in detection and triage of suspicious activities, threat hunting and incident response.

Ansible Security Automation allows security organizations to create pre-approved automation workflows, called playbooks, that can be maintained centrally and shared across different teams. And with the help of Tower, we can even provide those automation workflows to other teams in a controlled, user friendly and simple to consume way.
